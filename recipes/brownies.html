    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Claire Saffitz named these her “forever” brownies because it took so much work to get them right that she’s vowed to never develop another brownie recipe again.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup Dutch process cocoa powder (0.7 oz / 20g)</li>
        <li>5 ounces (142g) semisweet chocolate (preferably 64 to 68% cacao), coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter (3 oz / 85g), cut into pieces</li>
        <li>¼ cup neutral oil, such as vegetable or grapeseed (2 oz / 56g)</li>
        <li>½ cup granulated sugar (3.5 oz / 100g)</li>
        <li>½ cup packed dark brown sugar (3.5 oz / 100g)</li>
        <li>1 large egg (1.8 oz / 50g)</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks (1.1 oz / 32g)</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour (3.5 oz / 100g)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons malted milk powder (0.63 oz / 18g) (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (0.11 oz / 3g)</li>
        <li>6 ounces (170g) milk chocolate, coarsely chopped (1 cup)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and prepare line an 8 × 8-inch pan with 2 sheets of foil. Lightly butter the foil and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large heatproof bowl, whisk the cocoa powder and ¼ cup boiling water (4 oz / 113g) until smooth (this will bring out the flavor of the cocoa).</li>
        <li>Melt the chocolate, butter, and oil over a medium saucepan filled with about 1 inch of simmering water. Warm the mixture gently, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate and butter are melted and the mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li>Whisk the granulated and brown sugars into the chocolate mixture. Add the whole egg, egg yolks, and vanilla and whisk vigorously until the mixture looks very thick, smooth, and glossy.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, malted milk powder, and salt and whisk slowly until everything is combined, then whisk more vigorously until the batter is very thick, a full 45 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the milk chocolate to the batter and fold with a flexible spatula to distribute. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, spreading in an even layer all the way to the corners.</li>
        <li>Bake the brownies until the surface is shiny and puffed and the center is dry to the touch but still soft when pressed, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Allow the brownies to cool in the pan until they are no longer hot, about 1 hour, then refrigerate until the bottom of the pan feels cold, about 1 hour longer. Enjoy!</li>
